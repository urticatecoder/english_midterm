    <p id="homepara">Since Europeans first came to America, similar factors have played a role in shaping their interpersonal interactions, and the development of society. These factors not only largely motivated the day to day actions of early Americans, but through their integration into everyday life, helped to shape American society into what it has become today. Ultimately, these factors can be boiled down to the following three. First, God, who motivated a search for religious freedom, spurred a desire to convert Native Americans to Christianity, and led to many people committing actions in His name. Second, gold, which was an important factor in convincing European monarchs to finance journeys to America, and often drove the interactions between Europeans and Native Americans. And third, glory, something seeked by many an eager monarch, each wanting their name to go down in the history books. Together, these three factors tinctured the everyday interactions between peoples, and created the America that we know today. This website will attempt to explore how the early Americansâ€™ pursuit of God, gold, and glory shaped modern American society. Click on any of the tabs in the navigation bar to see how an explanation of God, gold, and glory in that time period, and the ways in which it led to the America we know today.
