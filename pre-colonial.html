    <p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>The question that this website explores asks, "how did the Early Americans' pursuit of God, gold, and glory shape modern American society?" However, this section talks mostly about Europeans. This is because the precolonial period was a time before large settlements existed in the Americas, and the United States of America was a long way from existing. So, the people who actually had an affect on modern American society during this time period were mostly European (with the exception of Native Americans).</p>
    <h1 class="header">Pre-Colonial</h1>
    <div class="bodypara">
      Before colonies formed and the Revolutionary War led to the official foundation of the United States of America, came the Pre Colonial period of American history: the time that started it all. This period consisted of explorers coming to America from Europe, interacting (and often fighting) with the present Native Americans, and claiming territory for their home countries. This Pre Colonial period provides many fantastic examples of the early Americans’ pursuit of God, gold, and glory. In fact, it may have been the only period that this website covers in which a pursuit of all three factors was present. During the Pre Colonial time period of American history, the actions of Europeans were largely motivated by God, gold, and glory, and these actions, which laid the basis for future colonies and nations, led to the American society that exists today.
      <br><hr>
      <div class="subheader">God</div>
      The first factor that tinctured the interactions of Early Americans during the Pre Colonial period was God. At this point in history, most of Europe was strongly religious, and it therefore made sense that God would play a large role in the way they acted. This was particularly true in Puritan society. Puritans were some of the earliest European settlers in America. Originating in England, they believed strongly that the Anglican church needed to be purified of all Catholic remains, hence the term Puritan. The Puritans were primarily characterized by the intensity of their religious practices. Christianity dictated every action they committed, and even played a large part in their government (“Puritanism," 2018). Before the Puritans came to America, there existed much religious turmoil in England between different rulers with different religious views. Puritans wanted a radical reform of the church, but were frequently persecuted for their beliefs (“Puritanism," 2018). As such, they defected to America, and in 1630, formed the Massachusetts Bay Colony in today’s New England. There, they carried out their vision of being like a “city upon a hill” for all to see and marvel at (“Massachusetts Bay Colony," 2018). Puritans held strong values of hard work, family, and above all else, dedication to God. They held that in order to be freed from their sinful state, people must be engaged in a covenant relationship with God, and they carried this belief with them in their every action (“Puritanism," 2018).

      <br>
      One prime example of a Puritan individual whose actions were motivated by God is Mary Rowlandson. While held captive of Native Americans, Rowlandson continually wrote a narrative about her experiences. Where someone today might attribute his or her navigation through such an experience to luck or cunning skill, Rowlandson attributes her survival entirely to God. At the very end of an excerpt from, A Narrative of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson, she writes, “Though some are ready to say I speak it for my own credit; but I speak it in the presence of God and to His glory” (Rowlandson, 1682). Clearly, Rowlandson was ready to attribute anything to God, due to her strong religious nature. In addition to the Puritans, almost all European people belonged to some form of Christianity during the Pre Colonial period (Danzer et. al., 2009).
      <br><br>
      Another example of the dominance of Christianity in Pre Colonial Europeans can be found in Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca’s La Relacion. In it, when the narrator sends out a group of men to complete some task, instead of referring to them simply as men, he refers to them as Christians: “We thought he was taking a long time to return, so I sent two other Christians to look for him and find out what had happened to him” (de Vaca, 1542). This quote shows the degree to which Christianity was present in the lives of Europeans, by illustrating that de Cabeza specifically perceived the characters in his novel as Christians, instead of people. Today, the effects of the Puritans and the rest of the Christian Europeans who inhabited the Americas during the Pre Colonial period can be widely seen. While America is becoming more and more secular, Religion still plays a large part in the lives of its citizens. In particular, Christianity. Churches can be seen in every city and in every town, most municipalities having several. In fact, according to Pew research, 70.6% of American adults identify as Christian, 76% say they strongly believe in God, and 68% say that religion plays a very important role in their lives. To be sure, the presence of God in America’s Pre Colonial time period has massively shaped America’s society today.

      <div class="subheader">Gold</div>
      In addition to God, the early Americans’ pursuit of gold, or wealth in general, has also shaped modern society into what it is. Before Europeans came to the Americas, the land was inhabited by indigenous peoples; Native Americans. Despite having them in abundance, these Natives held very little value in metals that were considered “precious” in Europe, such as gold and silver. Instead, their economies were largely driven by self production. Some Native American tribes hunted and gathered, some farmed, and many fished, but none of them put too much weight in capital gain. In fact, the concept of capital gain was hardly relevant in Native American societies, with most tribes exchanging goods through barter, and many different small items of value being used as currency (Carr, n.d.). Additionally, Native Americans viewed land as communally owned, and available for use by all. They saw it as a sacred giver of life, and had no concept of private land ownership in exchange for money (Danzer et. al., 2009).

      <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">Native Americans bartering furs to Europeans</p>
      <br>
      Europeans on the other hand came to America in large part because of the money that they expected to reap from it. Promises of gold by the boatload lured European monarchs into financing voyages to the new world, and once reports of the wealth gained by certain countries from their expeditions to the Americas was heard, more and more European nations followed (Danzer et. al., 2009). While some countries, such as Spain through Christopher Columbus, searched for wealth in the form of gold, others such as France and the Netherlands gained money from trade with the Native Americans.
      <br><br>
      One narrative of European pursuit of wealth in Pre Colonial America can be found in an excerpt from Adventures of Nicolas Perrot, 1665-1670. This excerpt, which follows a Frenchman in his interactions with Native Americans, displays the lengths to which the French were willing to go in order to secure trade with the Native Americans. According to the writings of this story, “At that time there was war between [the Outaouak] and their neighbors, the Malhominis… Perot, who was desirous of making their acquaintance, offered to mediate a peace between them” (de La Potherie, n.d.). As this quote displays, in order to secure lucrative interactions, Nicolas Perot was willing to insert himself into a violent war between two Native American tribes, about which he knew nothing. Without a doubt, the pursuit of gold and money impacted the lives and actions of the Europeans who came to the Americas during the Pre Colonial period. This pursuit of gold has also massively impacted modern American society. If gold-driven Europeans hadn’t come to America, it would most likely be driven by barter and trade today, as it was by the Native Americans. However, as a result of the European desire for money, today’s America is a capitalist powerhouse, with the highest GDP out of any country in the world: $21.5 Trillion (“The World’s Top Ten Largest Economies," 2018). Undoubtedly, the Pre Colonial early Americans’ pursuit of gold has played a large role in shaping American society into what it is today.

      <div class="subheader">Glory</div>
      The final way in which the pursuits of Pre Colonial Americans has led to modern American society is through glory. In this context, glory refers to what was sought by monarchs who hoped to be recognized as the individuals who led their countries to massive financial gains, and spurred the exploration of new lands. These pursuits were largely present during Pre Colonial times. Firstly, Kings all over Europe engaged in fierce competition over land in the Americas, each hoping to gain the glory associated with the ownership of that land. This was in large part brought about by the theory of Mercantilism, which held that the most powerful countries were those whose exports exceeded their imports by the largest degree; in other words, those who were the wealthiest. Because exploration of the Americas was largely inspired by a search for gold (as explored by the previous section of this page), many monarchs believed that by having the most holdings in the new world, they would cement their power, their legacy, and therefore the glory attributed to their name (“Gold, God, and Glory,” n.d.).

      <br>
      In order to contribute to this glory, many explorers were conditioned to attribute their discoveries to the monarchs who financed them. One piece that confirms this is an excerpt from Adventures of Nicolas Perrot, 1665-1670, by Charles Claude Le Roy de La Potherie. In the excerpt’s introductory paragraph, de La Potherie details the achievements of Nicolas Perot, saying, “He rendered very important services to the colony, made known the glory of the king among those peoples, and induced them to form an alliance with us” (de La Potherie, n.d.). By showing that Nicolas Perot told the Native tribes of the glory of his King, and the fact that this was greatly appreciated by the group of Frenchmen he is with, this quote illustrates how agents of the King made efforts to bolster his glory. While the pursuit of glory in this respect may not have directly shaped modern society to the same degree as did the pursuits of God and gold, it did still have an impact.
      <br><br>
      European monarchs were motivated to conquer lands in the Americas by competition with each other, each wanting to receive more glory than the next (“Gold, God, and Glory,” n.d.). Without this competition and the pursuit of comparative glory that came with it, American society today would not have been shaped by Europeans in the same way that it was. Additionally, monarchs and explorers did receive some glory as a result of their pursuits. For example, most students learn about various monarchs and their achievements in school, and some people such as Christopher Columbus have holidays dedicated to them. In the end, while it may not have impacted American society as directly as the pursuits of God and gold did, the pursuit of glory from Pre Colonial Americans and European monarchs has led to modern America being what it is today.
